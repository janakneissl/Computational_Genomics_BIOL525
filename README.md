Small programs I wrote for a class I took at UNC Chapel Hill

Prof. Terry Furey taught us the basics of genome sequencing including different sequencing technics, principles and how to analysize the data from different experiments. 
We also studied the basics of Linux and MySQL and used the Galaxy web interface.
